        <p>
            Oh, yeah <br>
            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone <br>
            You bled me dry just like the tears you never show<br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me?<br>
            Take what you need from me<br>
            Take what you want and go<br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me?<br>
            Take what you need from me<br>
            Take what you want and go
        </p>
        <p>
            I never needed anything from you <br>
            And all I ever asked was for the truth <br>
            You showed your tongue and it was forked in two <br>
            Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you <br>
            Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake <br>
            Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown <br>
            Like a plague, I was wasting away <br>
            Tryna find my way out, find my way out <br>
        </p>
